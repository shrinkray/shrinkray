# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Greg aka Shrinkray

I've built and managed bespoke WordPress themes, now moving into a framework realm. Over the recent years I've built sites and contributed to projects in NextJS, Sveltekit, Ghost, and experimented with headless CMS and GraphQL backends. I love working in web performance and pushing sites to improve scoring in Lighthouse and WebPageTest. 

I'm currently looking for work in UX Engineering.
